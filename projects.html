                Born Geometry and Relative Locality
            </h3>
            <p>
                My undergraduate thesis project. Born geometry is a geometric structure which can be placed on a 2n dimensional manifold
                which endows the manifold with certain symmetries of interest to theoretical physicists. The Born structure is composed
                of a para-hypercomplex structure along with some integrability conditions for the eigenbundles which come along with the 
                para-hypercomplex structure. A particular connection on the tangent bundle reduces to the Levi-Civita connection on phase spaceplus a torsion term.
                A connection on phase space with nonzero torsion causes an effect called relative locality, which modifies the Heisenberg Uncertainty relation.
                I derive the Born connection on a few complex manifolds, and find that Hopf manifolds possess a Born connection with nonzero curvature.

                Remote Control of Particles in Microhydrodynamic Suspensions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Manuscript in progress. This project is about controlling cargo in microfluids. Microfluidic chips are important 
                for constructing micro and nanomachines (through synthetic biology or otherwise). We tried to characterize
                the controllability of particles by various actuators, such as spherical beads suspended in the fluid which can be controlled using magnets.
                Similar work in this area has been done <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13550">here (arxiv link)</a>.

                Characterization of Optimal Experimental Designs and Parameter Estimation Methods for a Genetic Toggle Switch 
            </h3>
            <p>
                This was a poster I presented at the Canadian Undergraduate Math Conference in 2019 for my research with Nate Braniff and Brian Ingalls. 
                Optimal experimental design theory is a subfield of applied math and statistics, focused on improving the <it>a priori</it> design of experiments
                using information from a mathematical model. I investigated computational procedures for assessing OED performance and found some 
                counterintuitive results about the relationship between stochastic models and optimal designs!

            <h3>Stars Final Project</h3>
            <p>
                For my class on stellar structure, evolution, and formation, we had to do a group project! Our task was to modify the
                equations of stellar structure (see <it>Kippenhahn et al.</it>) to include a luminosity contribution from an accretion disk.
                We then had to generate a main sequence diagram and consider the effect of the modified relation on the locations of 
                convection zones, the opacities, and so on. My code and report can be found <a href=https://github.com/mastwood/Stars_Project>here!</a>
