The iGEM team is a student-lead research and design team, focusing on engineering applications of synthetic biology. In 2019, we used protein engineering methods to construct a protein which degrades a particular environmentally-dangerous herbicide. A detailed description of the project can be found at <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Waterloo">this link.</a> As a team lead, my role was to spearhead the computational modelling of the modified system as well as to mentor team members in mathematical synthetic biology. I mainly programmed finite element method simulations as well as some basic protein modelling. The project involved more than 30 team members, working on both the laboratory-based aspects of the project as well as the computational and software aspects.
