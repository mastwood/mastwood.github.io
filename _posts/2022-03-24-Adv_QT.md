In my third year I studied from Tobias Osborne's excellent Advanced Quantum Theory lectures. I took extensive notes for these lectures and designed graphics to go along with the blackboard drawings. Dr. Osborne personally commended my notes and posted them in the comments as well as in the description of each lecture.
