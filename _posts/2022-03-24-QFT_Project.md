In my third year I took two graduate courses, the second of which was a course in quantum field theory on curved spacetime.
My final project for the course was a python simulation which sampled from the Klein-Gordon field configuration space (using the Schrodinger field representation) in order to produce plots of quantum fluctuations, which are important to study in early universe cosmology as well as applied fields such as photonics and laser optics.
