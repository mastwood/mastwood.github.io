                    (A+) AMATH475: Intro to General Relativity. Taught by Eduardo Martin-Martinez.
                    Review of special relativity in mechanics and electromagnetism. Introduction to differential geometry: manifolds, vector fields, differential forms, 
                    the Lie derivative, the covariant derivative, the geodesic equation. Curved space-time and the Einstein field equations. 
                    The Schwarzschild solution and applications. The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models.

                    (B) STAT230: Probability. Taught by S. Banerjee.
                    This course provides an introduction to probability models including sample spaces, mutually exclusive and independent events,
                    conditional probability and Bayes' Theorem. The named distributions (Discrete Uniform, Hypergeometric, Binomial, Negative Binomial,
                    Geometric, Poisson, Continuous Uniform, Exponential, Normal (Gaussian), and Multinomial) are used to model real phenomena. 
                    Discrete and continuous univariate random variables and their distributions are discussed. Joint probability functions, 
                    marginal probability functions, and conditional probability functions of two or more discrete random variables and functions
                    of random variables are also discussed. Students learn how to calculate and interpret means, variances and covariances particularly
                    for the named distributions. The Central Limit Theorem is used to approximate probabilities.

                    (A) STAT231: Statistics. Taught by S. Banerjee.
                    This course provides a systematic approach to empirical problem solving which will enable students to critically assess the sampling protocol 
                    and conclusions of an empirical study including the possible sources of error in the study and whether evidence of a causal relationship can 
                    be reasonably concluded. The connection between the attributes of a population and the parameters in the named distributions covered in 
                    STAT 230 will be emphasized. Numerical and graphical techniques for summarizing data and checking the fit of a statistical model will be 
                    discussed. The method of maximum likelihood will be used to obtain point and interval estimates for the parameters of interest as well as 
                    testing hypotheses. The interpretation of confidence intervals and p-values will be emphasized. The Chi-squared and t distributions will be 
                    introduced and used to construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses including likelihood ratio tests. Contingency tables and Gaussian 
                    response models including the two sample Gaussian and simple linear regression will be used as examples.
