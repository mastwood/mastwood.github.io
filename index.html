            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a student of Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo! 
                What does that tell you about me? It means that I am obsessed with math, physics, and the basic sciences in general.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favourite things is education - providing new opportunities for students to learn things that they wouldn't 
                have heard of otherwise. This is why I've been involved with the Physics Club for my entire degree. Building a physics
                community is the key to allowing students to communicate and grow, and therefore allows them to experience more things
                than they would have just sitting in their dorm.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the past two years I've been involved with my university's iGEM team, which is a student research team which
                develops new applications of <it>synthetic biology</it>, which is the application of genetics and molecular biology
                to engineering. 
            </p>
