            <hr>
            <p>
                I am currently a student at Wilfrid Laurier University where I am completing an MSc thesis in Mathematics.
                I did my undergrad at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/science/undergraduate/programs/mathematical-physics">University of Waterloo</a>, 
                where I completed a degree in Mathematical Physics. I also completed a minor in Pure mathematics and a specialization in Astrophysics. 
                I typically like to work on physical and geometric problems, as well as data-driven problems.

                My masters project focuses on Greens' functions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold. I am trying to understand relationships between
                locally symmetric spaces and radial symmetry of Green's functions. I am also studying the N-body problem on manifolds, and trying to 
                understand the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics on complex manifolds, specifically Kahler manifolds.

                I am well versed in computer programming with Python, C++, Java, and more. I am interested in machine learning models for gravitational wave processing.
                A problem which interests me is the stochastic gravitational wave background radiation, and whether measurements of it can provide cosmological information.
                I am interested in problems of causality, time, and information. I like to think about relationships between geometry and physics,
                particularly symplectic and complex geometry. A series of blog posts by John Baez has caught my attention, which can be found <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/information/">here</a>. 
                The blog posts describe a connection between information geometry, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. I would be interested in pursuing projects related to this.

                I am interested in fluid mechanics and nonlinear partial differential equations in general. I have worked on geometric control theory
                results for microhydrodynamics. I would be interested in researching more geometric approaches to fluid mechanics.
