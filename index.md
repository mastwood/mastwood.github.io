I am a software engineer at Sandvine ULC, working in Waterloo Ontario.
I recently completed a MSc in Mathematics at Wilfrid Laurier University. Before that,
I completed a BSc in Honours Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo.

## Published Notes
This personal website serves two purposes. First is to act as a kind of resume, and secondly to distribute my publications openly.
I have completed two large scale note-taking projects, and the results can be found below.

### Advanced Quantum Theory - Taught by Tobias Osborne
My notes for Advanced Quantum Theory at University of Hannover have been approved and posted by Prof. Tobias Osborne. 
The video lectures can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDfPUNusx1Eo60qx3Od2KLUL4b7VDPo9F">here</a>.
My notes can be found <a href="https://github.com/mastwood/advancedquantum">here</a>.

### Clifford Algbras and Spinors - Taught by Spiro Karigiannis
My notes from PMATH945 - Clifford Algebras, Spinors, and Calibrations at University of Waterloo. 
The course was taught by Spiro Karigiannis in Fall 2020. He has approved these notes to be posted online.

## Technical Skills

### Research Interests
My research interests are primarily in applied differential geometry. I am interested in both computational
and theoretical aspects of geometry. In particular, on the computational side I am interested in manifold learning,
computational topology, and general dimensional reduction techniques. I have experience with real-time and static anomaly detection,
and I am interested in applications of the aforementioned methods to anomaly detection, classification, and causal analysis.
On the theoretical side I am more interested in mathematical physics. I am specifically interested in special structures on manifolds,
partial differential equations arising from relativity and gauge theory, and related topics in geometric analysis. I have worked
with complex and symplectic geometry in my research as well as pseudo-Riemannian geometry, which is specifically useful for relativity problems.

### Programming Languages

- Expert in Python, GoLang, MATLAB, and Mathematica
- Proficient in C#, Java, C++, Javascript, and R

The past few years I have most frequently worked with Python and Mathematica. For my work at Sandvine, I mostly use Python 3 as well as GoLang.
GoLang is useful for building scalable network interface applications for interacting with a large database. 
The majority of my personal projects are simulations, mostly of fluid mechanical systems or chemical processes. These systems are
modelled using partial differential equationsandr stochastic processes. I have additionally required other mathematically oriented
programming languages such as R or MATLAB, which are useful for statistical analyses and optimization problems respectively. 

### Packages and Technologies
The following is a rough list of APIs and software I have used for scientific and personal projects.
- FeNiCS, FireDrake, Numpy, Scipy, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow
- BLiTZ, PyCBC, Pandas, CasADI, Tkinter
- Matlab Optimization Suite
- NodeJS, Cheerio, Request, Express, DiscordJS, jQuery
- Gekko, APMonitor, GROMACS, PyMol, Visual Molecular Dynamics
- XNA, MonoGame
  
I have worked with various markup languages and similar technologies such as XML, HTML, CSS, and JSON. 
I am also experienced with Linux, having used Ubuntu through the WSL system as well as various other operating systems used in high performance computing clusters.
Furthermore, I have some experience with web-based platforms, having assisted in developing the iGEM team websites:

- <a href="https://igem.uwaterloo.ca/">iGEM Waterloo Team Website</a>
- <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Waterloo">iGEM Waterloo 2020 Project Website</a>
- <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Waterloo">iGEM Waterloo 2019 Project Website</a>

I have also developed a number of small web applications for personal use (some hosted via AWS, others hosted locally).

### Graphic Design
My graphic design experience is mostly relevant to game development or engineering positions. I have experience with 
3D modelling as well as vector and raster graphics. The following is a list of programs I have used extensively.

- Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
- GIMP, LaTeX, Inkscape
- Blender3D, AutoCAD
