I am currently completing my MSc in Mathematics at Wilfrid Laurier University. I will graduate in August 2022, and I am currently looking for full time positions in a quantitative discipline
such as data science, software engineering or mechanical engineering, or quantitative finance.

## Technical Skills

### Programming Languages
I have used the following languages for various projects over the years:
- Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, C#
- Java, C++, Javascript, R

The past few years I have most frequently worked with Python and Mathematica, although I keep my knowledge of object oriented programming sharp.
The majority of my projects are simulations, mostly of fluid mechanical situations or chemical processes. These systems have to be
modelled using either partial differential equations or stochastic processes. I have additionally required other mathematically oriented
programming languages such as R or MATLAB, which are useful for statistical analyses and optimization problems respectively. 

### Packages and Technologies
The following is a rough list of APIs and software I have used for scientific and personal projects.
- FeNiCS, FireDrake, Numpy, Scipy, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow
- BLiTZ, PyCBC, Pandas, CasADI, Tkinter
- Matlab Optimization Suite
- NodeJS, Cheerio, Request, Express, DiscordJS, jQuery
- Gekko, APMonitor, GROMACS, PyMol, Visual Molecular Dynamics
  
I have worked with various markup languages and similar technologies such as XML, HTML, CSS, and JSON. 
I am also experienced with Linux, having used Ubuntu through the WSL system as well as various other operating systems used in high performance computing clusters.
Furthermore, I have some experience with web-based platforms, having assisted in developing the iGEM team websites:

- <a href="https://igem.uwaterloo.ca/">iGEM Waterloo Team Website</a>
- <a href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Waterloo">iGEM Waterloo 2020 Project Website</a>
- <a href="https://2019.igem.org/Team:Waterloo">iGEM Waterloo 2019 Project Website</a>

As well as a number of small web applications (some hosted via AWS, others hosted locally).

### Graphic Design
My graphic design experience is mostly relevant to game development or engineering positions. I have experience with 
3D modelling as well as vector and raster graphics. The following is a list of programs I have used extensively.

- Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign
- GIMP, LaTeX, Inkscape
- Blender3D, AutoCAD
